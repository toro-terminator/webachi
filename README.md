# Webachi Design System

> Web Components are only used for this layout system documentation

 - Web Template names need to match JS and CSS file names

---

> Everything is running via PostCSS

`npm run watch-css` will .... watch css/webachi.css

*postcss.config.js* is where you can stack plugins

---

`npm run watch-js` will .... watch and lint /js

**terminal window must say "Clean"**

---

`npm run build-js` will .... watch /js and concat then compress to .build/webachi.min.js

**you have to add new js files to the build scripts command**
